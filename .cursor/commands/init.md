# Initialize context-engineering artifacts

Initialize the following context-engineering files and folders **if they do not exist**. Use minimal, sensible placeholders. **Do not overwrite** anything that already exists.

| Artifact | Location | Placeholder / Notes |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **DESIGN.md** | Project root | System goal and high-level design. Brief intro + placeholders for goals, KPIs, architecture. |
| **logs/** | Project root | Empty directory. **Story work:** `logs/<story_name>/<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM>.md`. **Root logs** (when not on a story): `logs/<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM>.md`. |
| **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** | Project root | Planning doc. Short intro + placeholder for Epics / Stories / Tasks and their status (table or list). |
| **memories.md** | Project root | Personal preferences (style, local conventions). One-line note that this is for personal prefs; rest empty. |

After running, list what was **created** and what **already existed**.
