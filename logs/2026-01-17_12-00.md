# Session: 2026-01-17
**Context:** logs/ (root)
**Goal:** Implement workflow rules improvements and project setup

## Tasks
- Add Session Start + Every Turn checklists
- Add git branching table
- Reorder sections
- Clarify logs vs plan distinction

## Thinking
Starting with the workflow.mdc restructure. Need to:
1. Add checklists at top
2. Reorder sections (checklists → lifecycle → git → context engineering → planning → learning)
3. Clarify log vs plan in context engineering section

Will read current file first, then rewrite with new structure.

## Done
Rewrote workflow.mdc with:
- Session Start Checklist (3 items)
- Every Turn Checklist (4 items with "ask human" triggers)
- Two Artifacts table (logs vs plan)
- Git Branching table (quick task vs story)
- Reordered: Checklists → Lifecycle → Git → Context Eng → Planning → Learning
- Clarified logs as scratchpad for context offloading

## New Task: Add ruff linting
- Add ruff to dev deps
- Configure ruff in pyproject.toml
- Update python-stack.mdc rules to mention ruff

Done:
- Added ruff>=0.9 to dev deps
- Configured [tool.ruff] with sensible defaults (E, W, F, I, UP, B, SIM, RUF)
- Added Linting & Formatting section to python-stack.mdc
- Fixed 6 lint issues in skill-creator scripts
