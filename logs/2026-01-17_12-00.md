# Session Log: 2026-01-17

## Goal
Implement workflow rules improvements per the plan:
- Add Session Start + Every Turn checklists
- Add git branching table
- Reorder sections
- Clarify logs vs plan distinction

## Thinking
Starting with the workflow.mdc restructure. Need to:
1. Add checklists at top
2. Reorder sections (checklists → lifecycle → git → context engineering → planning → learning)
3. Clarify log vs plan in context engineering section

Will read current file first, then rewrite with new structure.

## Done
Rewrote workflow.mdc with:
- Session Start Checklist (3 items)
- Every Turn Checklist (4 items with "ask human" triggers)
- Two Artifacts table (logs vs plan)
- Git Branching table (quick task vs story)
- Reordered: Checklists → Lifecycle → Git → Context Eng → Planning → Learning
- Clarified logs as scratchpad for context offloading

Next: verify the rules work by testing.
